   - Paste Account SID and Auth Token
   - Set your Twilio phone number

## How to Use

1. **Enter Twilio Credentials**: 
   - Get Account SID and Auth Token from [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)

2. **Set Phone Numbers**: 
   - "Phone Number to Call": Your Twilio number (e.g., +13136311821)
   - "Your Personal Number": Your actual phone number (e.g., +923164203806)

3. **Initialize Device**: Click "Initialize Device" to set up the WebRTC connection

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to get access token"
- Check that you entered correct Twilio Account SID and Auth Token
- Verify credentials from [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### "Device not ready"
- Wait for "Device Ready" status before calling
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Twilio credentials are valid and have sufficient balance

### "Call failed"
- Ensure phone numbers are in E.164 format (+1234567890)
- Check that your Twilio account has sufficient balance
- Verify your Twilio number is active and configured

## Architecture

This app uses a completely standalone architecture:

1. **Frontend** (`public/index.html`): Handles UI, credentials, and WebRTC calling
2. **Backend** (`server.js`): Generates access tokens using user-provided credentials
3. **No Configuration Files**: Everything is entered through the web interface
4. **No Environment Setup**: No .env files or server configuration needed

## Security Notes

- âœ… Auth Token is never saved to localStorage for security
- âœ… Account SID is saved locally for convenience (non-sensitive)
- âœ… All credentials are sent securely to backend for token generation
- âœ… No credentials are stored on the server
- ðŸ”’ For production: Add HTTPS and consider rate limiting

## API Endpoints

- `POST /token` - Generate access token for WebRTC client
- `POST /make-call` - Make outbound call via Twilio API
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## File Structure

```
